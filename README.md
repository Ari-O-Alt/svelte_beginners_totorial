##### Steps to take: 
- You must have **Node.js** installed.
- I am using **VS Code** as a code editor. I also installed the following extensions: **Svelte for VS Code** and **Svelte 3 Snippets**.
- Create a folder where you want to keep your Svelte project then open that folder inside VS Code.
- To create a new Svelte project, open the Terminal and run the following command: **npx degit sveltejs/template [nameOfTheProject]**
- If the project has been created successfully, you should see the following message: **cloned sveltejs/tmeplate#HEAD to [nameOfTheProject]**
- Navigate inside the project folder: **cd .\[nameOfTheProject]\**
- Run **npm install** (if you're using npm) or **yarn** (if you're using Yarn). This will install the needed project packages.
- To start the app, type **npm run dev** or **yarn dev**
